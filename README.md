## Project Goals

1.  **Learning CSS Grid and Flexbox**

    From a technical aspect, my desire was to learn how to manipulate and control css grid and flexbox

2.  **Recreation**

    While I took some color freedoms, my desire was to create as accurate a representation of the proportions of the board as possible. 

3.  **Partial Game Data**

    While my initial intention was just to create the board, I was eventually inspired to attempt to make the game itself. This was very early on in my learning, but you can see the game being played by the computer in the console. This was all written in Vanilla JavaScript.
